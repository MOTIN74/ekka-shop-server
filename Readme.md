# Rentive Car

This project is fully responsive, please visit the live site [Rentive Car]().

## Available Scripts

In the project uses: - Node JS, - Express JS, - Nodemon, - MongoDB, - Heroku.

### Here are some ideas about this project

- Primarily, this is Rentive Car Server site .
- If you look at its code, you will understand that it is a server side of Mango DB Atlas.
- Then you can see that some dynamic API has been used..
- I have made some APIs through CARD operation and hit the data from the client side. Since it is a dynamic project, we have used database in it. Hopefully this project will improve in the future and will be a user friendly project.

- How do you feel about our project? And of course let us know your valuable feedback on how we can try better. Thanks..ðŸ˜˜
